A project for the MDS Game Development Methodologis class in my masters. 

For this class, we were challenged to make a Game Development Document, a Tech Bible and a Demo/prototype for a game concept. 

In this git you can find the project files for the demo game Redacted:  a puzzle type game in a office setting, with SCP flavouring. 
In Redacted you play as a new employee of the SCP Foundation, analyzing reports and issuing or not a team for containment if you see any supernatural influence. 
Armed with binder with all the avaiable information you need to decifer the text and clues of the events to see if there are any supernatural forces at play.
All in a days work,

If you think you are up to the challenge you can submit your aplication and get hired at : https://pmoco.itch.io/redacted
